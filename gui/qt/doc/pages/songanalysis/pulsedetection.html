        <p>The pulse detection of a song is done by running an external process using a matlab executable provided by M. Murthy and D. Stein from Princeton. Below is their summary and the detailed description of their code:</p>

				<td>SUMMARY:</td>
				<td>Analyzes the song clip and based on where putative pulse trains are identifiedi, extracts individual pulses within these clips using wavelet transformation. This is done by computing the continuous wavelet transform of the song clip for the derivative of guassian (DoG) wavelet family, which represent pulses, to those computed for the morlet wavelet, representing sines, and flags events as pulses dependent on if the DoG coefficient was higher.</td>

			<td>DETAILED DESCRIPTION:</td>
			<td><p>This script attempts to segment putative pulse trains into individual pulses. Its data requirements are the flysong clip and an internal structure pps, which contains the start and stop times and the clips themselves for the putative pulse trains. The idea behind pulse segmentation is quite simple: we flag an event as pulse if it looks more like a pulse than a sine! This is done in several steps.</p>

				<p>Step 1) A typical pulse looks very similar to the Derivative of Gaussian a.k.a. the 'mexican hat' wavelet. A whole family of such funcations can be generated by repeatedly taking derivatives, and the first few members of this family look very similar to observed Drosophila melanogaster courtship song pulses (other species pulses may be better fit by different wavelets and wavelet families). We use these as our canonical pulse shapes. We then use the Continuous Wavelet Transform (cwt) to correlate the song clip (from pps) with each of these canonical pulse shapes. For each DoG wavelet, we perform the CWT over a range of 'scales'. 'Scale' can be roughly thought of as the inverse of frequency, and sweeping over scale values in effect correlates the song clip with stretched and compressed versions of each pulse shape. This allows us to test a broad range of possible pulse shapes.</p>

				We then repeat the same procedure with the morlet wavelet (sinusoid with a guassian enevelope) over the same range of scales. 

				<p>Step 2) Step 1 gives us CWT coefficients for each pulse shape and each scale. In Step 2, we pool the coefficients across the different pulse shapes to find the best-matched shape and scale at each point in time i.e. this will allow us to say that at 2.3 seconds into the clip, the best matched pulse shape was a second order mexican-hat at a frequency of 200 Hz. We do the same thing for the Morlet (sine) wavelet as well. So at the end of this step, instead of having coefficients for each pulse shape and sine shape and for each different scale, we have one set of coefficients representing the best matched pulse shapes, and one set of coefficients representing the best matched sine shapes. Comparing these two allows us to see which fits better. this winnowing procedure are the 'true' pulses, and saved in pulseInfo2.</p></td>

		All acquired data is saved to files into the according project file folder and can be read by MateBook after the external process has finished. Also the user can change several parameters before running the pulse detection, by choosing "Settings" --> "Song Analysis" --> "Pulse Detection Options".
