        The song analysis allows automated processing and statistical analysis of the courtship songs of the fruit fly, also known as <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. First the courtship song is analysed for pulses, by running the pulse detection process. After that the user can modify the song manually (adding and deleting pulses), or run a statistical analysis immediately.
