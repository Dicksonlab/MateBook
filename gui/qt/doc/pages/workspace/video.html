        In this tab the user can watch the whole video file. If arenas where already detected, those are listed as child items of the file item representing the video file in the lower half of this view. Also detected arenas are highlighted in the video player by drawing a square at the position where the program thinks the arena is located.

        When an arena item is selected in the list, it also gets highlighted where it is located in the video. In this view the user can select an arena item that he wants to display inside the "Arena" tab.
