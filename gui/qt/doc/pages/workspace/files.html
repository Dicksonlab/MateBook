        The "Files" tab views all files within a project that were added by the user. Each row in this view represents one file and the columns contain information for each file.

		<ul>
			<li><b>Recording:</b> When adding a file to a project and no further operations were conducted, the file is in this stage.</li>
			<li><b>Arena Detection:</b> Describes the process of detecting vessels, where the flies are held, in video files.</li>
			<li><b>Fly Tracking:</b> Describes the process of analysing an detected arena for courtshipbehavior of two flies in video files.</li>
			<li><b>Pulse Detection:</b> Describes the process of detecting pulses of a courtshipsong in audio files.</li>
			<li><b>Modifying File:</b> The user is able to modify an audio file after the pulse detection was performed.</li>
		</ul>

and each stage has one of four available status: Failed, Queued, Started, Finished.
