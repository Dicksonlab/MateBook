        <p>
        The song tab displays an audio file as a plot and provides detailed information on its data, which was obtained during pulse detection and statistical song analysis. The audio file can be played, paused and stopped. At the top right side the user can change settings regarding the data that is to be displayed, by choosing "Display Settings". The song data can be manually modified (creating and deleting pulses), saved and reloaded by choosing "Data Options". Also within the "Data Options" the user is able to perform a statistical analysis on the current song file. </p>
		
		<p>General data about the song is displayed at the bottom of this view inside the "Song Details" tab. There are three lists. One listing all detected pulses and the corresponding cycles per pulse, one displaying the start positions of all IPIs, together with each IPI length in milliseconds and the final one listing all detected trains, the train lengths and the number of pulses inside a train. The user can click on each list entry to highlight the selected list item inside the plot or the other way round.</p>
