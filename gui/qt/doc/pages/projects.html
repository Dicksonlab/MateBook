        MateBook allows the user to manage files in projects. For each project a project folder and a ".mbp" file, to be able to open a project, is created. For each file inside a project, another folder inside the project folder is created. This file folder contains all the data that was obtained on this file, by the program.

        <table align="center" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" border="0" width="100%">
        <tr valign="top" bgcolor="#f0f0f0">
        <td><center><img src="images/projectfolder.png" /></center></td>
        </tr>
        </table>

        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
        The actual files can be stored anywhere (local harddrive, external harddrive, ...), because MateBook just saves the path to a file, and loads the file data only when it is really needed. If the path of a file has changed, there is the possebility within MateBook to change the path of a file manually, selecting the new location of the file.
